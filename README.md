# Lung-Cancer-Detection
Developed an advanced system for detecting malignant pulmonary nodules from CT scans, leveraging the power of Deep Learning. Utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, inspired by the robust C3D network architecture, this system excels at extracting intricate features from volumetric scan data. The result is a highly effective tool that not only identifies malignant lung nodules with an impressive 86% accuracy but also provides predictive malignancy scores for each detected nodule. The implementation of this system was carried out using TensorFlow, showcasing its capability in handling complex, real-world medical imaging tasks. This innovation represents a significant step forward in the early detection and treatment planning of lung cancer, democratizing access to advanced diagnostic technologies.
